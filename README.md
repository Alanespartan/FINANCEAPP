<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is a personal finance management tool, that aims to provide a comprehensive software solution that consolidates all the essential features users need to effectively manage their finances.

The application is designed to support a wide range of financial management capabilities, including:

- Tracking balances across cash, credit and debit cards, loans, savings accounts, and investments.
- Recording transactions between different accounts.
- Visualizing installment purchases (msi) and their remaining payments.
- Automating the registration of recurring income or expenses in specific accounts.
- Generating income and expense projections for future months to forecast potential balances, whether positive or negative.
- Creating detailed financial reports to help users identify spending patterns and make informed decisions to achieve greater financial stability.

By unifying these features into a single platform, the project seeks to deliver a robust tool for financial organization and planning, allowing users to do smarter spending and having financial awareness.
